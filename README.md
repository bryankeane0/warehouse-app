# Warehouse Management System

Solo Project: Semester 3


## Description

This projects allows the user to carry out typical CRUD functions to a warehouse. The user can create new floors, add aisles to each floor, add shelves to each aisle, add pallets to each shelf and add goods to each pallet.
Linked lists were used so the head reference to a floor is a new linked list of aisles and so on; essentially creating nested linked lists. The user can list all contents of the warehouse and search for floors, aisles, shelves, pallets and goods.
Users can use a smart add function, where they can add a type of goods after which the system will find a suitable aisle and shelf on which to place the pallet of goods. There is also a reset facility to start from scatch.

Finally there exists a save and load feature along with an assortment of JUnit tests ensuring method's integrity despite code refactoring.
